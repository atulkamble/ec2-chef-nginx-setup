# EC2 Chef Configuration for Nginx Deployment

This project shows how to use Chef to configure an EC2 instance for Nginx. It provides a step-by-step guide for setting up Chef, creating cookbooks, and deploying Nginx. This project automates server configuration and application deployment with Chefâ€™s management tools.

This project demonstrates the process of using Chef to set up Nginx on an Amazon EC2 instance. The repository includes:

1. Chef Environment Setup: Commands for creating the project and cookbook directories.
2. Cookbook Creation: Instructions for generating and editing a cookbook to install and manage Nginx.
3. Recipe Execution: Steps to run the Chef recipe locally and verify Nginx installation.
4. Verification: Instructions for checking the Nginx version and accessing it via a web browser.

### EC2 - Chef Configuration

Comprehensive guide for configuring an EC2 instance using Chef to install and manage Nginx. Follow the steps below to set up the Chef environment, create a cookbook, and deploy Nginx on an EC2 instance.

#### 1. Create Project Folder

Initialize a new Chef repository with the following command:
```bash
chef generate repo myproject
```

Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd myproject
```

Change to the cookbooks directory:
```bash
cd cookbooks/
cd ..
```

#### 2. Create Cookbook

Generate a new cookbook for Nginx:
```bash
chef generate cookbook cookbooks/nginx
```

Navigate to the recipes directory within the Nginx cookbook:
```bash
cd cookbooks/nginx/recipes/
```

Edit the `default.rb` recipe file:
```bash
sudo nano default.rb
```

Paste the following code into `default.rb`:
```ruby
package 'nginx' do
  action :install
end

service 'nginx' do
  action [:enable, :start]
end
```

#### 3. Run Recipe

Execute the Chef recipe in local mode:
```bash
sudo chef-client --local-mode --runlist recipe[nginx::default]
```

#### 4. Verify Nginx Installation

Check the Nginx version to ensure it has been installed correctly:
```bash
nginx -v
```

#### 5. Access Nginx

Obtain the public IP address of your EC2 instance and open it in a web browser. Ensure that the inbound rule for port 80 is configured in the Security Group:
```
SG: Inbound rule - 80
http://instance-ip:80
```
